# OneDrive Free Client
###### A complete tool to interact with OneDrive on Linux. Built following the UNIX philosophy.

### Features:
* State caching
* Real-Time file monitoring with Inotify
* Resumable uploads
* Support OneDrive for Business (part of Office 365)

### What's missing:
* Shared folders are not supported
* While local changes are uploaded right away, remote changes are delayed
* No GUI

## Setup

### Dependencies
* [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
* [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/)
* [Digital Mars D Compiler (DMD)](http://dlang.org/download.html)

### Dependencies: Ubuntu/Debian
```sh
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
curl -fsS https://dlang.org/install.sh | bash -s dmd
```

### Dependencies: Fedora/CentOS
```sh
sudo yum install libcurl-devel
sudo yum install sqlite-devel
curl -fsS https://dlang.org/install.sh | bash -s dmd
```

### Installation
Installation involves activating the dlang compiler, compiling the code, installing the binary and then deactivating dlang:
```sh
source ~/dlang/dmd-2.077.0/activate
git clone https://github.com/skilion/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
make
sudo make install
deactivate
```

### First run :zap:
After installing the application you must run it at least one time from the terminal to authorize it. 

You will be asked to use your web browser to open a specific link where you will have to login into your Microsoft Account and give the application the permission to access your files. The request will look like this:
```sh
Authorize this app visiting:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=22c49a0d-d21c-4792-aed1-8f163c982546&scope=files.readwrite%20files.readwrite.all%20offline_access&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient

Enter the response uri: 
```
After opening the link in your browser, you must authorize the app, after which you will be redirected to a blank page. Copy the URI of the blank page into the application and enter it in the terminal where it says:
```sh
Enter the response uri: 
```
The application will then start to sync with OneDrive.

### Uninstall
```sh
sudo make uninstall
# delete the application state
rm -rf .config/onedrive
```

## Configuration
Configuration is optional. By default all files are downloaded in `~/OneDrive` and only hidden files are skipped.
If you want to change the defaults, you can copy and edit the included config file into your `~/.config/onedrive` directory:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/onedrive
cp ./config ~/.config/onedrive/config
nano ~/.config/onedrive/config
```

Available options:
* `sync_dir`: directory where the files will be synced
* `skip_file`: any files or directories that match this pattern will be skipped during sync.

Patterns are case insensitive. `*` and `?` [wildcards characters](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490639.aspx) are supported. Use `|` to separate multiple patterns.

Note: after changing `skip_file`, you must perform a full synchronization by executing `onedrive --resync`

### Selective sync :zap:
Selective sync allows you to sync only specific files and directories.
To enable selective sync create a file named `sync_list` in `~/.config/onedrive`.
Each line of the file represents a path to a file or directory relative from your `sync_dir`.
Here is an example:
```text
Backup
Documents/latest_report.docx
Work/ProjectX
notes.txt
```
Note: after changing the sync list, you must perform a full synchronization by executing `onedrive --resync`

### OneDrive service
If you want to sync your files automatically, enable and start the systemd service:
```sh
systemctl --user enable onedrive
systemctl --user start onedrive
```

To see the logs run:
```sh
journalctl --user-unit onedrive -f
```

### Using multiple accounts
You can run multiple instances of the application specifying a different config directory in order to handle multiple OneDrive accounts.
To do this you can use the `--confdir` parameter.
Here is an example:
```sh
onedrive --monitor --confdir="~/.config/onedrivePersonal" &
onedrive --monitor --confdir="~/.config/onedriveWork" &
```

`--monitor` keeps the application running and monitoring for changes

`&` puts the application in background and leaves the terminal interactive

## Extra

### Reporting issues
If you encounter any bugs you can report them here on Github. Before filing an issue be sure to:

1. Have compiled the application in debug mode with `make debug`
2. Run the application in verbose mode `onedrive --verbose`
3. Have the log of the error (preferably uploaded on an external website such as [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/))
4. Collect any information that you may think it is relevant to the error (such as the steps to trigger it)

### All available commands:
```text
Usage: onedrive [OPTION]...

no option        Sync and exit
       --confdir Set the directory used to store the configuration files
        --logout Logout the current user
-m     --monitor Keep monitoring for local and remote changes
   --print-token Print the access token, useful for debugging
        --resync Forget the last saved state, perform a full sync
       --syncdir Set the directory used to sync the files are synced
-v     --verbose Print more details, useful for debugging
       --version Print the version and exit
-h        --help This help information.
```

### File naming
The files and directories in the synchronization directory must follow the [Windows naming conventions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247).
The application will crash for example if you have two files with the same name but different case. This is expected behavior and won't be fixed.
